# Big-O Notation

* Measure the time and space complexities of an algorithm.
* Represents the algorithms worst case complexity

Major types of complexities:
* Constant: O(1) - good
* Linear time: O(n) - good
* Logarithmic time: O(n log n) - ok
* Quadratic time: O(n^2) - bad
* Exponential time: O(2^n) - bad
* Factorial time: O(n!) - very bad
